# Logistic-Regression-with-Neural-Network-mindset
building a logistic regression classifier to recognize cats (meow!)

###### Build the general architecture of a learning algorithm, including:
- Initializing parameters
- Calculating the cost function and its gradient
- Using an optimization algorithm (gradient descent)
Gather all three functions above into a main model function, in the right order.
